| Sub-Step                     | Description                                                                 | Deliverables / Outcomes                                      | Best Practices / Notes                                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements Gathering        | Collect functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.      | Requirement documents, stakeholder interviews, questionnaires | Engage all key stakeholders, avoid assumptions        |
| Feasibility Study             | Evaluate technical, operational, and financial feasibility of the project. | Feasibility report, risk assessment                          | Be realistic about constraints and limitations        |
| Requirement Analysis          | Analyze and prioritize requirements; identify system constraints.          | Requirement specification, use cases, user stories           | Use modeling techniques like UML or flowcharts        |
| Requirement Validation        | Verify requirements for clarity, completeness, and consistency.            | Validated requirements document                               | Conduct reviews and walkthroughs with stakeholders    |
| System Modeling               | Create models to visualize processes, data, and interactions.              | Data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, UML models | Use diagrams to simplify complex requirements         |
| Approval & Sign-off           | Obtain formal approval from stakeholders on the documented re
